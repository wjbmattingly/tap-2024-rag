    "# Retrieval Augmented Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) brings together vector databases and LLMs to leverage the strength of each while, in theory, helping mitigate their weaknesses. Let's learn  a bit about how this technology works.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does RAG Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind RAG sits a vector database. This is used to store knowledge that can be used to generate better responses from a LLM. When a user queries a vector database with RAG, they don't explicitly perform semantic search, as you normally would with a vector database. Instead, they frame a natural question, just like they would with an LLM. A RAG application then goes into the vector database and finds the sources that most align with the specific query. The RAG system then gathers this material and provides it to an LLM along with the user's initial question. These retrieved documents frame the context for guiding the LLM to generate a more precise and specific response.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RAG system then receives the output from the LLM and provides the response to the user. Because the LLM's response is rooted in context explicitly provided to it, the RAG system knows the original source material that frame the response. This means that the RAG system can help the user validate the response from the LLM by providing the user the specific sections of each document that was used to provide a better response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strengths of RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "The key strength of a RAG system is the ability to provide LLMs with a new knowledge base. This is often knowledge that they were not trained on or knowledge that was out-of-scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this, a RAG system can limit the chance for hallucinations. By providing explicitly the context needed to answer a user's question, the LLM's chances of hallucinating are diminished. It is important to note, though, that they are not removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a RAG system allows a user to understand specifically *why* an LLM generates a response by providing the user with the original source material used to frame the response. Thus, a user not only gets a response from an LLM, they also can navigate the original data and find relevant material more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weaknesses of RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "While RAG systems seem like the perfect answer to the limitations of LLMs, they must be used cautiously. RAG is still a fairly new technology and current research suggests that the chances for hallucinations have not entirely disappeared. Even if a user has access to the original source material, what if they opt to not view it? If a hallucination is generated by an LLM on your system and you function as an authority, does that make the LLM's response an authority? These are the questions that make it challenging to put RAG systems into production, especially when working with cultural heritage data.\n",

    "# Loading the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a vector database, you must start with data. We will be working with data from [Founders Online](https://founders.archives.gov/). This data is available in the `../data/processed/` folder. I have provided us with a sample of 10, 100, and 1,000. For this notebook, we will be working with a sample of 1,000. It is important to note that I have seeded the random sample. This means that the data you work with each time will be the same. To get different data, change the seed of the script, located in `./src/data/` called `download_data.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data is a collection of writings of the Founders. The data is useful for doing social network analysis as many of the writings are letters. It's also useful for mapping writings across time and space as many of the writings are dated and contain information about specific locations. For our purposes, however, we will be working with the main content of the letters to create a vector database. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, let's load the data. We will be using `srsly`. I'm including this in this tutorial as a way to introduce students to the library. You can also use the standard `json` package here. `srsly` has a few advantages, namely it loads the data as a generator. This is useful when you start working with larger datasets (as you typically do with vector databases) because the entire dataset is not loaded into memory at once. Because of this, though, we want to convert it to a list just to make it a bit easier to use for our purposes, so when loading the data, we convert it to a list with the `list()` function.\n"

    "# Chunking Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can begin creating a RAG system, though, we need to manipulate our data. One of the key issues with LLMs is that they have a limited context window, or quantity of tokens (think of these as words for now) that they can ingest. The context window is filled by both the input text and the output from the LLM. This means that we cannot simply give smaller LLMs an entire book and be able to get a specific output. In order to resolve this issue, we often need to chunk our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chunking is when we take an input text and turn it into a sequence of smaller components. When chunking, we have a lot of methods to choose from.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Character-Based Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "Character-based chunking involves splitting the text into chunks based on a fixed number of characters. This method is simple but can be problematic as it may split words or sentences in unnatural places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Simple to implement\n",
    "- Consistent chunk sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- May split words or sentences inappropriately\n",
    "- Doesn't consider semantic meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def character_chunk(text, chunk_size=1000):\n",
    "    return [text[i:i+chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(text), chunk_size)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Whitespace-Based Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "Whitespace-based chunking splits text at whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) to create chunks. This method preserves whole words but may result in varying chunk sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Preserves whole words\n",
    "- Simple to implement\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Can result in inconsistent chunk sizes\n",
    "- May split sentences or paragraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def whitespace_chunk(text, max_words=200):\n",
    "    words = text.split()\n",
    "    return [' '.join(words[i:i+max_words]) for i in range(0, len(words), max_words)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Token-Based Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "Token-based chunking uses a tokenizer to split text into tokens (which can be words, subwords, or characters depending on the tokenizer) and then groups these tokens into chunks of a specified size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Aligns well with LLM token limits\n",
    "- Can be more precise than character or whitespace chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Requires a tokenizer\n",
    "- May still split sentences inappropriately\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from transformers import AutoTokenizer\n",
    "\n",
    "def token_chunk(text, max_tokens=512):\n",
    "    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"gpt2\")\n",
    "    tokens = tokenizer.encode(text)\n",
    "    return [tokenizer.decode(tokens[i:i+max_tokens]) for i in range(0, len(tokens), max_tokens)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentence-Based Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence-based chunking splits text into individual sentences and then groups these sentences into chunks. This method preserves sentence integrity but may result in varying chunk sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Preserves sentence meaning\n",
    "- More semantically coherent chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Can result in inconsistent chunk sizes\n",
    "- Requires sentence tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (using spaCy):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import spacy\n",
    "\n",
    "def sentence_chunk(text, max_sentences=10):\n",
    "    nlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n",
    "    doc = nlp(text)\n",
    "    sentences = [sent.text for sent in doc.sents]\n",
    "    return [' '.join(sentences[i:i+max_sentences]) for i in range(0, len(sentences), max_sentences)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Paragraph-Based Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "Paragraph-based chunking splits text into paragraphs and then groups these paragraphs into chunks. This method preserves paragraph integrity and is useful for maintaining context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Preserves paragraph context\n",
    "- Often aligns with natural text structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Can result in very inconsistent chunk sizes\n",
    "- May produce overly large chunks for long paragraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def paragraph_chunk(text, max_paragraphs=5):\n",
    "    paragraphs = text.split('\\n\\n')\n",
    "    return ['\\n\\n'.join(paragraphs[i:i+max_paragraphs]) for i in range(0, len(paragraphs), max_paragraphs)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each chunking method has its own advantages and disadvantages. The choice of method often depends on the specific requirements of your RAG system, the nature of your text data, and the capabilities of your LLM. It's common to experiment with different chunking methods to find the one that works best for your particular use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Semantic-Based Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic-Based Chunking performs sentence-based chunking. Next, it looks for sentences that are similar and merges them together into a single chunk. The goal of this approach is to have chunks that are distinct in meaning across an entire document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Keeps chunks highly relevant\n",
    "- Allows for you to retrieve fewer results to provide the necessary context to answer a question\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Could be difficult to understand broader context of parts of a chunk"

She explains that her sister went to bed on Saturday night feeling well except for a slight sore throat, but in the middle of the night she awoke feeling chilled and oppressed on her lungs. Despite calling for a doctor, her sister passed away peacefully and without the knowledge or suspicion of her attendants. Abigail describes her sister's life as a continued series of useful services, extending beyond just providing food and clothing to also shaping the minds, manners, and morals of the many youths under her care. She mentions that her sister's husband trusted her completely and considered her his pride, glory, and crown. Abigail expresses deep sorrow and loss over her sister's passing.\n"
